The font used in the customized part of the logo (the text "Istanbul") resembles the font used in the original logo.
It is called "Red Hat Display" and is an open source font.
To edit the logo, you can use the free tool [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).
You will need the logo files in [Red_Hat_Display](vendor%2FRed_Hat_Display) installed on your machine.

Assets:
- [logo.svg](logo.svg): The logo with the text "Istanbul" added. Not square.
- [logo_twitter.svg](logo_twitter.svg): Square logo, with some padding. Twitter crops the image to a circle.
